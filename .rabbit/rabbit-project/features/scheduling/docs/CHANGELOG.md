## contract 0.1.2 — 2026-06-10

- Wired the two new deterministic adapters into the route-as-data loop:
  `PRIORITIZE` (prioritize) and `IMPLEMENT` (implement, dry-run) are now in
  `DEFAULT_ADAPTER_MAP` (mapped to `run_tick:make_prioritize` /
  `run_tick:make_implement`), so an override route
  `TRIAGE → PRIORITIZE → IMPLEMENT` wires with NO code change. The default route
  is unchanged (read-and-idle spine; the two new ports are wireable but omitted).
- Surfaced two new per-tick ephemeral read products, `execution_plan` and
  `handoffs`, alongside `work_items`/`work_orders`. They are persisted per #64
  discipline (overwritten each tick, empty when the active route did not route the
  producing stage — no stale carry-forward) and shown unconditionally in BOTH the
  tick trace and `status.py` (#69), in the order
  `work_items work_orders execution_plan handoffs`.
- Added persisted-read-product helpers `persisted_execution_plan/_count` and
  `persisted_handoffs/_count` (mirroring the work_orders helpers). Added `BLOCKED`
  (IMPLEMENT's signal) to the closed signal vocabulary. Consumes prioritize +
  implement UNCHANGED; edits only in scheduling. Informational stdout only; no
  typed schema field changed.

## contract 0.1.1 — 2026-06-10

- Fixed auto-maintainer-framework#69: `status.py` now ALWAYS reports
  `work_orders=N`, including `work_orders=0`, matching the tick trace's
  unconditional `work_orders=N` field. The previous conditional (append
  `work_orders` only when the count was truthy) made a default (no-TRIAGE)
  tick's status drop the field, so a reader could not distinguish "no TRIAGE
  routed" from "TRIAGE ran, found nothing", and status diverged from the tick
  trace. Field order is unchanged (disposition, work_items, work_orders, route,
  runtime_dir). Informational stdout only; no typed schema field changed.
