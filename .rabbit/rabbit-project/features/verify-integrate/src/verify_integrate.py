"""verify-integrate — slice 1: the read-only VERIFY gate.

The act-side CLOSE of the loop (DESIGN §3.7): after IMPLEMENT opens a PR, VERIFY
gates it on CI + mergeability + base. VERIFY is READ-ONLY and always safe — it
lists the loop's open PRs and derives one Verdict per PR; it never merges,
closes, or writes to GitHub.

The cross-tick model (refines DESIGN §2.6): a PR's CI runs asynchronously, so
GitHub — not a durable ledger — is the source of truth for the loop's open PRs.
Each tick VERIFY QUERIES `gh pr list --label auto-maintainer --state open`; a PR
opened in tick N is re-checked every tick until its CI goes green. The VERIFY
manifest therefore declares reads=[] (the PR set is sourced LIVE from gh, not a
blackboard slot); it writes the `verdicts` slot.

The only non-deterministic edge — the live `gh` call — sits behind an INJECTABLE
source (Verify(source=...)), so tests drive VERIFY with a stub over fixture PRs
with no network (spec-rules §1: the failure is locatable to the fetch boundary,
never a flaky live call). The default-branch lookup is likewise injectable.

Public surface (slice 1):
  - VERDICT_SCHEMA_VERSION + Verdict — the typed, versioned verdict schema.
  - VERDICTS_SLOT     — the fsm-contracts slot registration descriptor.
  - VERIFY_MANIFEST   — the VERIFY state's {reads, writes, emits} manifest.
  - VERIFY_SIGNALS    — the closed signal set VERIFY may emit (OK | EMPTY).
  - gh_open_pr_source()       — the production source: shells the gh CLI.
  - gh_default_branch_source() — the production default-branch resolver.
  - derive_verdict(pr_dict, default_branch) — the pure verdict derivation.
  - Verify            — the VERIFY state; run(TickContext) -> StateResult.

INTEGRATE and CLEANUP are slice 2 and are NOT implemented here.

Version: 0.1.0
Owner: changyu87
Deprecation criterion: Superseded when the loop adopts a non-git VCS backend,
  or a model-backed verify/integrate policy replaces the deterministic gh-based
  gates, or when the Verdict / IntegrationResult schemas reach a breaking major
  version. See docs/spec.md.
